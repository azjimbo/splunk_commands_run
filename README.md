# splunk_commands_run
A quick Splunk query to count how often folks use which commands.  

Takes the word after a pipe | and stats them against the users.

This information can be used in a variety of ways.  Want to understand what senior team mates are doing so you can teach others?  Want to gauge how well junior team mates are grasping concepts?

May eventually incorperate this into a dashboard that would drilldown to the actual queries being run.  ...on the list of things to do.

If you find a way to do this better, please let me know.  This was tossed together in an afternoon; it's got foibles I'm sure.
